1) Extract the contents to a folder and run testLob.php
2) Check the postcard generated on Lob with the credentials:
Email : ssharm14@ncsu.edu
Password : test1234

If this does not work/error is generated, install composer :
1) https://getcomposer.org/download/
2) Delete the existing vendor folder, composer.json and composer.lock
3) Open cmd and type : composer require lob/lob-php:1.4.*

Now, load the php file and check the website for the generated postcard.
